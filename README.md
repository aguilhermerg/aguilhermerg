### 🎯 About Me

I'm a former logistics and supply chain pro turned **data analyst**. After over a decade in business operations at companies in Brazil and Germany, I made a career switch to follow my passion for **data-driven decision-making**.

I completed an intensive **Data Analytics Bootcamp** at [Tripleten](https://tripleten.com), where I built a solid portfolio of **14+ hands-on projects**, all published on GitHub.
